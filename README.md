To use this script, first argument should be a text file with the list of files you want to filter on (each file name on a new line)
The second argument should be the extension you want to filter on e.g. "jpg"

An example of the command would look like:

./filter_file_list.py list.txt jpg

This filters the files found in list.txt for extension of jpg e.g. file1.jpg
